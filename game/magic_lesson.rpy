    a "Good morning."

    y "I see you've been practicing."

    "Sometimes she can just tell things like that."

    a "I have."

    y "Well let's see how your practice has paid off. Focus on the web."

    a "Ugh."

    y "That's ok. Try again. Remember, the Web is just as much in you as it is outside of you."

    y "Don't think of it as trying to conjure something that wasn't there a moment ago."

    y "Concentrate on your own breath. Feel the Web of power that sustains your every breath and every pump of your heart."

    "I take a deep breath and try again."

    "There's a prickling sensation, like static electricity running up my fingers and up to my back."

    a "I did it! It's staying this time."

    y "Good. Now, channel your focus to a point"

    y "Right now you're spread thin. That's good when you want to tune into the Web, but to cast a spell you'll need to pinpoint a spot where two lines of the Web connect."

    a "I'm trying but it's... fuzzy..."

    show ayata

    a "Agh, I lost it."

    y "Ari, the Web is a part of you. It's a part of all of us. But only with training can you unlock its potential for magic."

    y "You've come far, I've seen your hard work and dedication. But you misunderstand your relationship to the Web."

    a "What do you mean? I'm doing what you say, I'm concentrating on my breath and I'm channeling my focus..."

    y "The Web itself is not just magic, and it does not exist just for us Witches to use it for our spells."

    y "It keeps us alive every moment of the day. It is the fabric of reality. Magic is in our blood."

    y "Neither of us command or control the Web, neither do we control magic."

    a "I know, I know. We just channel it or change its shape to suit our needs."

    y "Yes, but not only that."

    a "What do you mean?"

    y "Well if the Web comprises the fabric of reality and we manipulate the web to create magic, what could that mean for, well, reality?"

    a "That we could warp reality with magic?"

    y "All magic is a form of reality bending. In our current reality, there's no light in this room but the sunlight coming through the windows."

    show light at left

    "!!"

    y "And now there is a little more light, because I conjured it!"

    y "So Witches are always manipulating reality to suit our needs and whims."

    y "But just like a spider web, the Web of reality can only bend so much before it will break."

    a "Break? What do you mean break?"

    y "Okay, back to the lesson."

    a "But wh--"

    y "Concentrate!"

    "..."

    "I pass the next hour or so practicing tuning into the Web, pinpointing my focus to one spot on the grid, and "

    y "Well, I think that's enough for today. Excellent work, Ari."

    a "I didn't even get any closer than last time..."

    y "You are making excellent progress Ari. Most of my students do not make half as much progress in two years as you have made over the last six months."

    a "Thank you, Ayata."

    y "Hm."

    a "What?"

    y "You still don't trust your own abilities."

    a "How can I trust them when they're not even working for me? I've been training for six months and I can barely cast a light spell!"

    y "Ari, were you listening to me? You need to be patient. You've already shown more progress than most of my students."

    y "You dont't think you have the skills necessary to trust yourself yet."

    y "But remember what I said--the Web is a part of you. Magic is a part of you."

    y "If you cannot trust yourself, you will not be able to access its full power."

    a "What does that even mean? What does trust have to do with it?"

    y "It will make sense to you in time."

    y "I'm afraid we'll have to cut our lesson a little short today, I have some tedious advisor duties to attend to today."

    a "Like what?"

    y "A royal banquet of some sort."

    a "Oh yeah, real tedious stuff..."

    "I can picture it now. Trays of steaming hot buns, piles of fruit, dates, and almonds... "

    "Women in their royal court finest, exchanging the latest gossip under twinkling lights cast above them by Witches."

    "So tedious."

    y "But, such is the life I chose when I decided to settle down in Suren for a quiet life of scholarship."

    a "Why did you decide to come live here if it's boring to you?"

    y "Even the busy hummingbird must someday return to its nest."

    a "What?"

    show ayata happy

    y "Besides, I was known to cause a bit of a stir during my day. I imagine there's probably still a bounty on my head in at least a few of our neighboring nations."

    a "What??"

    y "That's a tale for another time."

    a "Right..."

    "It always is with Ayata."

    y "I'll be off then. Keep practicing and strengthening your connection to the Web tonight. Tomorrow we'll work on light spells."

    a "Alright, see you tomorrow."

    "With that, I head back to my flat."

    scene flat

    a "Graypaw, I'm home!"

    g "Just in time to interrupt my nap, I see."

    a "Well that would be just about any time, since you're always napping!"

    "It looks like Graypaw has already gone back to sleep and isn't listening to me."

    "My familiar is a little grumpy but I know he's secretly glad I'm home."

    a "Let's see what we have for dinner."

    "I check my pantry."

    "I have some vegetables and rice that I could cook up. And I still have the rest of the day to practice magic after a quick lunch."

    "But rice just doesn't sound as appealing when just over at the palace they're going to be feasting on all kinds of roast meats, baked treats, exotic fruits..."

    "I just want to know what it tastes like."

    "But I should probably get a head start on my practice..."

    "What should I do?"
