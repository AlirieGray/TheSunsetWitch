    "I've had enough magic for one day. I'm going to see if I can get into the feast."

    "Just to try the food! Then I'll come straight home and work on my magic."

    "I don't really own a ton of fancy clothes, but I think with a little illusion spell I'll be able to blend right in."

    "I decide to grab a purple robe from my closet, black slippers, and a hood for good measure."

    "The ladies of the royal court usually wear long, flowing dresses with detailed embroidery."

    "I usually see them coming and going from the palace from the windows of the library where Ayata teaches her magic lessons."

    "It takes me a while, but I manage to cast an illusion that looks like fashionable embroidery running along the seams of the robe."

    "I glance at myself in the mirror before I head out."

    "I look a little out of place walking down the streets of my neighborhood in this fancy outfit, but there's so much hustle and bustle in the early evening that no one pays me any mind anyway."

    "It's less than an hour until sunset now. As I walk up the hill to the palace, I see guests of various ranks making their way to the palace as well."

    "What am I even doing? Just the outfit isn't going to be enough to get into a royal palace event I wasn't invited to..."

    "What even is my plan? Just join the crowd of nobles I am clearly not a part of and hope the royal guards just assume I belong?"

    "Lie about my identity?"

    "I wonder if they have some sort of invitation. After all, the guards can't be expected to recognize every single person who was invited."

    "Even from here, I can see a few dozen people who look like they're attending this banquet."

    "I squint to try to make out if they have some sort of invitation in their hands, but I can't see anything."

    "I guess I'll just go to the door and hope for the best. If I need to conjure a fake invitation I should be able to do it."

    "Although it took me nearly an hour to turn my robes into a ball gown, a little invitation card should be easier."

    "As I get closer, I can see through the open door into the banquet hall."

    "The sweat is collecting on my forehead. I step up to the door."

    "Now my mouth REALLY feels dry."

    t "Yep! That's me, crown princess. And you are?"

    a "Um, Ari."

    t "Nice to meet you Ari. I'm guessing by your robes that you're a witch?"

    a "Well, I'm an apprentice still."

    t "Wow, that is so amazing! You must be able to do so many amazing things with your powers."

    a "Um... well, I am still learning. But yeah I guess I can do a couple cool things."

    t "You know, a long time ago the mages used to rule Suren."

    # ari normal

    a "Really?"

    t "Yes, they ruled from the mage tower on the far side of the city. It's been abandoned for hundreds of years though."

    a "Why is it abandoned?"

    t "Oh, one thousand years ago the evil sorceress Elukath was deposed by her sister, who started the royal line I descend from."

    a "No, I mean why is it abandoned? Couldn't the royal line have ruled from the mage tower? Or used it for something else?"

    show tarenza worried

    t "Well... Strange stuff tends to happen there."

    a "Strange stuff?"

    t "Yeah, there's all sorts of rumors. There's no telling which are true."

    t "People say that time runs backwards there, that people remember events they've never seen and forget their own identities."

    t "That the stairs descend infinitely into the heaves and people go mad from the sight of whatever is at the top..."

    a "What? How can that be possible?"

    t "Well, they're just rumors. I'm sure the truth is much less interesting."

    "That does sound kind of like the stuff that Ayata was telling me about earlier."

    "Time running differently, space stretching in unusual ways... I wonder why she didn't tell me anything about the mage tower if it's so important."

    a ""

    t "Perks of being heir to the throne I guess. If something important happens in the city I usually know about it."

    t "Since you're new to the royal court, have you seen the palace gardens yet?"

    a "No, I haven't."

    t "Oh good! Then would you like to see?"

    a "Like, right now?"

    t "If you'd like."

    a "Um... sure, that sounds good."
